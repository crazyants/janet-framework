# jaNET Framework
A free and open source IoT framework that provides a set of built-in functions, a native API ([Wiki](https://github.com/jambelnet/janet-framework/wiki)), and multiple providers, such as scheduler, evaluator, notification manager and others, to allow a 3rd party software (e.g. [Jubito](http://www.jubito.org), see details below) to exploit, in order to interact with multiple services, software applications and vendor hardware (especially open hardware, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, etc). It is designed for interoperability, therefore, to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic. It can operate on any device that is capable of running .NET Framework or Mono (Linux, Windows, Mac, including single-board computers, such Raspberry Pi and Banana Pi).
