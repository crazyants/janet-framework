# jaNET Framework
A free and open source IoT framework that provides multiple functions and native API that allow 3rd party software (e.g. jubito.org) to utilize, in order to interact with multiple vendor hardware (especially open hardware, e.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, etc). It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic and can run on any device that is capable of running .NET Framework or mono-runtime (Linux, Windows, Mac).

# Jubito
A complete solution is [Jubito](http://www.jubito.org). An awarded IoT hub ([Technical Enabler: Application Enablement](http://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-award/2014/iot-application-enabler/) - [Honors & Awards](jubitoblog.blogspot.com/search/label/awards)) based on jaNET Framework. [Download](http://www.jubito.org/download.html) Jubito and examine index.html and jubito.core.js under /www/ directory to understand how the web application layer communicates and implements the framework. Afterwards you'll be able to create [custom widgets and more](jubitoblog.blogspot.com/2016/08/consuming-restful-data.html).
