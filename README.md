# jaNET Framework
A free and open source IoT framework that provides multiple built-in functions and a native API ([Wiki](https://github.com/jambelnet/janet-framework/wiki)) that allow 3rd party software (e.g. [Jubito](http://www.jubito.org), see details below) to utilize, in order to interact with multiple vendor hardware (especially open hardware, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Banana Pi, etc). It is designed to be absolutely neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic and can run on any device that is capable of running .NET Framework or mono-runtime (Linux, Windows, Mac).
